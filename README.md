# Notes and Findings about Red Star OS
This repository contains information about my findings and notes from talks I
have given about Red Star OS, the North Korean Linux distribution.

## What is Red Star OS?
Red Star OS is the infamous Linux distro developed in North Korea by the
[Korea Computer Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Computer_Center).
In development since 1998, the OS was initially released in 2008 with version 1.0,
with a version 2.0 released in 2009, and followed by version 3.0 in 2012. Version
4.0 of Red Star was released in either 2019 or 2020, depending on sources cited, but
a DVD ISO image has yet to be leaked. My talk and most information on Red Star OS in
the wild is taken from version 3.0.
